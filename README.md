### Hi, Taylor Here ðŸ‘‹

I do a lot of web frontend & backend development, TypeScript and C# are my special favorites.

Picking up on new technologies and frameworks is a talent of mine. I'm quite familiar with the big web view frameworks: Vue, React, and Angular. Whatever the best tool for the job is! ðŸ˜„ There's a lot you can do with the prerendered static sites, no backend involved. However, when I backend, I use ASP.NET, Node.js, and Python.
