### Hi, Taylor Here

I'm a developer of public sector software; I do a lot of web frontend & backend development, C# and TypeScript are my favorite languages.

Picking up on new technologies and frameworks is a talent of mine. I'm quite familiar with the big web view frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue. Whatever the best tool for the job is! There's a lot you can do with the prerendered static sites, no backend involved. However, when I backend, I use ASP.NET, Node.js, and Python.
